Hello^_^ I'm Ashe/Arashi/Linglan. 

Welcome to my homepage. Feel free to have a look around. And... I don't like to use IM, it always makes me stressed ;-; , So please forgive me if I ghost you on Instagram, WhatsApp, or WeChat. I'm sorry about it. (Hope they can see my apologies here...)  I think I like to receive long emails and take a few days to reply. I always want to ask ppl to email me instead of sending short IM messages. But this request might be a bit ... impolite? So if you see this line, maybe send me an email about anything?

The Stoic school suggests that when someone asks you what's on your mind, you should be able to respond without hesitation. I hope to be a practitioner of Stoicism myself, openly sharing my thoughts and reflections on my blog, this small personal space of mine. I want to maintain transparency and honesty and aspire to be unashamed and unreserved, being honest with the world. I reckon that the way the world opens to you is by opening yourself first.

And I like pink sunsets, cosmic space, and movies about lonely people falling in love.
